- Challenge 1: Initialize weights and biases

- Challenge 2: Implement the sigmoid function

- Challenge 3: Do a forward pass

- Challenge 4: Estimate gradient

- Challenge 5: Do one step gradient descent

If you would like to explore NNs in depth, [Nielsen's book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) is a great start.

NNs are plotted using [this tool.](http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/index.html)
